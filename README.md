# Search-and-Rescue-Robot

A project that uses CLIP to search and find particular objects or people - as described by a text input.
This would eventually be hooked up to a small raspberry PI robot running Simulatneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) to drive to these objects. Object segmentation will be used in conjunction with SLAM so that objects spotted in the 2D video feed can be located in the 3D coordinate space.
